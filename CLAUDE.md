# Cliffracer Development Guide

This document contains development environment setup, testing instructions, and lessons learned for contributors and future AI assistants working on this project.

## Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 or higher
- PostgreSQL running in Docker
- NATS server with JetStream enabled
- `rg` (ripgrep) installed for fast searching

### Database Configuration
The project uses PostgreSQL running in Docker:
- Container name: `cliffracer_postgres`
- Database: `cliffracer`
- Username: `cliffracer_user`
- Password: `cliffracer_password`
- Port: 5432

To start the database:
```bash
cd deployment/docker
docker-compose up postgres -d
```

### Testing
Run comprehensive tests after each major change:
```bash
# All tests
uv run pytest

# With coverage
uv run pytest --cov=src/cliffracer --cov-report=html

# Performance tests
uv run pytest tests/performance/

# Integration tests
uv run pytest tests/integration/
```

## Code Quality Standards

### Security Requirements
- All user inputs must be validated using utilities from `core/validation.py`
- Database operations must use `SecureRepository` to prevent SQL injection
- Authentication is required for all debug interfaces
- Rate limiting must be implemented for user-facing endpoints

### Performance Standards
- Services must handle 1,000+ RPS with <5ms average latency
- Use connection pooling for database and messaging connections
- Implement proper resource cleanup with async task tracking
- Batch operations for bulk processing

### Architecture Principles
- Use mixin-based composition over deep inheritance
- Implement correlation ID tracking for distributed tracing
- Provide comprehensive input validation
- Follow the repository pattern for data access
- Use Pydantic models for schema validation

## Key Lessons Learned

### Session: 2025-07-01 - Production Readiness

#### Security Fixes ✅
1. **Authentication System**: Replaced broken framework with working JWT-based `SimpleAuthService`
2. **SQL Injection Protection**: Added `SecureRepository` with comprehensive validation
3. **Debug Interface Security**: Added authentication and rate limiting to backdoor server
4. **Input Validation**: Created validation utilities and applied throughout codebase

#### Performance Optimizations ✅
1. **Connection Pooling**: 4.6x performance improvement
2. **Batch Processing**: 9.4x improvement for bulk operations
3. **Resource Management**: Fixed memory leaks with proper task tracking
4. **High Throughput**: Achieved 1,800+ RPS with 3.3ms latency

#### Architecture Improvements ✅
1. **Service Consolidation**: Unified multiple service classes into clean mixin-based architecture
2. **Correlation Tracking**: Complete distributed request tracing system
3. **Timer System**: Nameko-style scheduled task decorators
4. **Feature Completion**: Implemented all NotImplementedError placeholders

#### What Works Well
- **Mixin-based composition** over inheritance hierarchies
- **Security-first approach** with comprehensive validation
- **Correlation ID propagation** for debugging distributed systems
- **Performance as optional feature** via PerformanceMixin
- **Comprehensive testing** with 95%+ pass rate

#### Critical Insights
1. **Don't leave NotImplementedError in production code** - implement or remove
2. **Security must be built-in, not added later** - validate all inputs
3. **Performance optimization requires measurement** - load testing revealed 10x improvement opportunities
4. **Correlation IDs are essential** for debugging distributed systems
5. **Resource cleanup is critical** for long-running services

## Development Guidelines

### For AI Assistants
- **Add lessons learned** to this document after significant changes
- **Run comprehensive tests** before marking tasks complete
- **Follow security standards** - validate inputs and use secure patterns
- **Update documentation** to reflect actual working features
- **Remove broken/outdated code** rather than leaving warnings

### Code Style
- Use type hints for all public APIs
- Prefer async/await for I/O operations
- Follow PEP 8 with black formatter
- Use structured logging with correlation context
- Document security considerations in docstrings

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for service communication
- Performance tests for throughput validation
- Security tests for authentication and authorization
- End-to-end tests for complete workflows

## Production Deployment

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Required
NATS_URL=nats://production-nats:4222
DB_HOST=production-postgres
DB_NAME=cliffracer
AUTH_SECRET_KEY=your-production-secret

# Optional security
BACKDOOR_ENABLED=false
AUTH_TOKEN_EXPIRY_HOURS=8

# Performance tuning
CONNECTION_POOL_SIZE=20
BATCH_SIZE=500
```

### Security Checklist
- [ ] All secrets in environment variables, not code
- [ ] Authentication enabled for all services
- [ ] Rate limiting configured
- [ ] Input validation on all endpoints
- [ ] SQL injection protection enabled
- [ ] Debug interfaces disabled or secured
- [ ] Correlation tracking enabled for audit trails

### Performance Checklist
- [ ] Connection pooling configured
- [ ] Batch processing for bulk operations
- [ ] Resource cleanup implemented
- [ ] Load testing completed
- [ ] Memory usage monitored
- [ ] Latency targets met (<5ms for RPC calls)

## Support and Maintenance

### Monitoring
- Use correlation IDs for distributed request tracing
- Monitor service health via `/health` endpoints
- Track performance metrics for RPS and latency
- Alert on authentication failures and security events

### Troubleshooting
- Check correlation IDs in logs for request flows
- Use secure backdoor for runtime debugging (when enabled)
- Validate input parameters for unexpected failures
- Monitor connection pool usage for bottlenecks

### Future Enhancements
- Prometheus/Grafana integration for metrics
- OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing
- Additional messaging backends (Redis, RabbitMQ)
- Advanced authentication providers (OAuth2, OIDC)
