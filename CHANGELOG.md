  - Role and permission-based authorization
  - Context-aware authentication using Python's `contextvars`
  - FastAPI middleware integration
  - Decorators: `@requires_auth`, `@requires_roles`, `@requires_permissions`

#### SQL Injection Protection
- **SecureRepository**: Enhanced repository with comprehensive validation
  - Whitelist of allowed table names
  - Regex validation for SQL identifiers
  - Field name validation against model schemas
  - Suspicious pattern detection in parameter values
  - Maximum identifier length enforcement (PostgreSQL limits)

#### Request Correlation Tracking
- **Correlation ID System**: Complete distributed request tracing
  - Automatic ID generation and propagation across services
  - HTTP header extraction/injection (`X-Correlation-ID`, `X-Request-ID`, etc.)
  - NATS message propagation
  - WebSocket support
  - Structured logging integration with correlation context

#### Performance Optimizations
- **High-Performance Service**: 1,800+ RPS with 3.3ms average latency
- **Connection Pooling**: Database and messaging connection management
- **Batch Processing**: Bulk operations with configurable batch sizes
- **Resource Management**: Proper async task tracking and cleanup
- **Zero-overhead Metrics**: Performance monitoring with minimal impact

#### Input Validation
- **Comprehensive Validation Utilities**: Protection against invalid inputs
  - Port number validation (1-65535 range)
  - Timeout bounds checking with configurable min/max limits
  - String length validation to prevent memory exhaustion
  - Username/password validation with security requirements
  - SQL identifier validation to complement injection protection

#### Development Tools
- **Secure Debug Interface**: Enhanced backdoor server with authentication
  - Password authentication required (environment variable or auto-generated)
  - Rate limiting with maximum 3 attempts per IP
  - IP-based lockout for 5 minutes after failures
  - Constant-time password comparison (timing attack resistant)
  - Session timeout (30 seconds for authentication)

#### Service Architecture
- **Consolidated Service Classes**: Clean mixin-based architecture
  - `CliffracerService` as the main service class
  - Feature mixins: `HTTPMixin`, `WebSocketMixin`, `ValidationMixin`, `PerformanceMixin`
  - Backward compatibility with legacy class names
- **Timer System**: Nameko-style scheduled task decorators
  - `@timer.interval()` for periodic tasks
  - `@timer.cron()` for cron-style scheduling
  - Integration with service lifecycle and metrics

#### Database Features
- **Enhanced Models**: Complete Pydantic model system
  - `DatabaseModel` base class with common fields (id, created_at, updated_at)
  - `get_create_table_sql()` method for automatic schema generation
  - Type mapping from Python to PostgreSQL types
  - Automatic trigger creation for `updated_at` fields

#### Messaging System
- **Complete Abstract Messaging**: Pluggable messaging backend support
  - Fixed `MessageClientFactory` implementation
  - Complete `Message` dataclass with required fields
  - NATS client fully implemented and tested
  - Support for multiple messaging backends

### üîß Fixed

#### Critical Security Issues
- **Broken Authentication**: Completely replaced non-functional auth system
- **SQL Injection Vulnerabilities**: Added comprehensive input validation
- **Unprotected Debug Interface**: Added authentication and rate limiting
- **Resource Leaks**: Fixed async task cleanup in `BatchProcessor`
- **Missing Input Validation**: Added validation throughout the codebase

#### Implementation Issues
- **NotImplementedError Methods**: Implemented all placeholder methods
  - `TokenService` methods now delegate to working `SimpleAuthService`
  - `MessagingFactory` now uses existing `MessageClientFactory`
  - `DatabaseModel.get_create_table_sql()` fully implemented
- **Import Errors**: Fixed broken imports and module dependencies
- **Test Failures**: Updated tests to work with consolidated architecture

#### Performance Issues
- **Memory Leaks**: Proper task tracking with `WeakSet` references
- **Connection Management**: Enhanced connection pooling and lifecycle management
- **Resource Cleanup**: Graceful shutdown with task cancellation

### üóëÔ∏è Removed

#### Outdated Documentation
- `IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`: Replaced with accurate README
- `TYPING_STATUS.md`: Outdated type safety information
- `scripts/refactor_class_names.py`: No longer needed after consolidation

#### Broken Features
- Removed references to non-working authentication in examples
- Cleaned up broken import statements
- Removed placeholder warning messages

### üìö Documentation

#### Complete Rewrite
- **Professional README**: Comprehensive feature list and examples
- **Updated Examples**: All examples now use working features
- **API Documentation**: Clear usage patterns and configuration options
- **Security Guide**: Best practices for production deployment

#### Architecture Documentation
- Clear project structure explanation
- Service configuration patterns
- Database integration examples
- Authentication and authorization patterns

### üß™ Testing

#### Enhanced Test Suite
- **Correlation ID Tests**: 15 comprehensive tests covering all aspects
- **Security Tests**: Validation of authentication and authorization
- **Performance Tests**: Load testing framework with benchmarks
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end service communication testing

### üöÄ Performance

#### Benchmarks
- **RPC Throughput**: 1,800+ requests/second
- **Average Latency**: 3.3ms response time
- **Memory Efficiency**: <1MB growth under sustained load
- **Connection Pooling**: 4.6x performance improvement
- **Batch Processing**: 9.4x improvement for bulk operations

### üí° Migration Guide

#### From Previous Versions

1. **Authentication**: Replace any auth imports with `simple_auth`
   ```python
   # Old (broken)
   from cliffracer.auth.framework import AuthenticatedService
   
   # New (working)
   from cliffracer.auth.simple_auth import SimpleAuthService, requires_auth
   ```

2. **Repository Usage**: Use `SecureRepository` for database operations
   ```python
   # Old
   from cliffracer.database import Repository
   
   # New (secure)
   from cliffracer.database import SecureRepository
   ```

3. **Service Classes**: Use consolidated service architecture
   ```python
   # Old
   from cliffracer import ValidatedNATSService, HTTPNATSService
   
   # New (unified)
   from cliffracer import CliffracerService
   from cliffracer.core.mixins import HTTPMixin
   ```
