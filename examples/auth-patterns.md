# ⚠️ BROKEN: Authentication Patterns

> **THIS DOCUMENTATION IS BROKEN**
> 
> The authentication system described here is not implemented and contains import errors. 
> See [IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md](../IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md) for current status.

## Current Status: NOT IMPLEMENTED

The authentication module referenced in this document has the following issues:

1. **Import errors**: References non-existent `auth_framework` module
2. **Disabled exports**: Auth classes commented out in `__init__.py`  
3. **Broken middleware**: HTTP auth middleware cannot be imported
4. **No working examples**: All auth examples fail with import errors

## What's Planned (Not Available)

- JWT token authentication
- Role-based access control
- HTTP middleware integration
- Context-based authentication

## What to Use Instead

For authentication, consider using:
- FastAPI's built-in auth decorators
- External auth services (Auth0, Keycloak)
- Custom middleware outside of Cliffracer

This document will be updated when authentication is properly implemented.
